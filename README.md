Angular Flex Layout provides a sophisticated layout API using FlexBox CSS + mediaQuery. 
This module provides Angular (v2.x and higher) developers with component layout features using a 
custom Layout API, mediaQuery observables,and injected DOM flexbox-2016 css stylings.  

The Layout engine intelligently automates the process of applying appropriate FlexBox CSS to 
browser view hierarchies. This automation also addresses many of the complexities and workarounds 
encountered with the traditional, manual, CSS-only application of Flexbox CSS. 

The **real** power of Flex Layout, however, is its **responsive** engine. The [Responsive API](https://github.com/angular/flex-layout/wiki/API-Overview#responsive-features) 
enables developers to easily specify different layouts, sizing, visibilities for different 
viewport sizes and display devices.

The latest release of Angular Flex-Layout can be installed from npm

### IMPORTANT API CHANGE

Directive selectors are now camelCase (instead of dash-case); as specified in the Angular Style Guide (Q4, 2016):

*  @Component selectors always use dash-case
*  @Directive selectors always use camelCase
> Except when the directive is pretending to be a component (i.e, if it had a template it would be '<ng-content></ng-content>').
*  @Directive properties are prefixed with namespace info
> @Component properties are not


```html
<div class="flex-container" 
     fxLayout="row" 
     fxLayout.xs="column"
     fxLayoutAlign="center center"
     fxLayoutAlign.xs="start">
  <div class="flex-item" fxFlex="20%" fxFlex.xs="40%">  </div>
  <div class="flex-item" fxFlex>        </div>
  <div class="flex-item" fxFlex="25px"> </div>
</div> 
```

### Why choose Flex-Layout

While other Flexbox CSS libraries are implementations of:

* pure CSS-only implementations, or 
* the JS+CSS Stylesheets implementation of Angular Material v1.x Layouts.

Angular Flex Layout - in contrast - is a pure-Typescript UI Layout engine with an implementation that: 

*  uses HTML attributes (aka Layout API) to specify the layout configurations
*  is currently only available for Angular (v2.x or higher) Applications.
*  is independent of Angular Material (v1 or v2).
*  requires no external stylesheets.
*  requires Angular v2.x or higher.
